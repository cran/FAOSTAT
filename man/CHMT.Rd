\description{
  We assume that if the pre-aggregates exists then the
  individual level are present. This function should only
  used when performing aggregation.
}
\details{
  We decide to use the smaller subsets in the regional
  level because weighting variable may not exist for other
  variables for the larger subsets.

  The function only work for FAOST_CODE, if the country
  coding system is not in FAOST_CODE then use the
  translateCountryCode function to translate it.
