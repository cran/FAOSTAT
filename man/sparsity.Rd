\title{A function to calculate the sparsity of the variable}
\usage{
  sparsity(year, var, data)
}
\arguments{
  \item{year}{The column which index the time}

  \item{var}{The variable to calculate sparsity}

  \item{data}{The data frame.}
}
\description{
  When two or more variables are merged together, it is
  very likely that spurious sparsity is created. This is
  due to the fact that the years between the variables are
  not identicle and is particularly true for data stored as
  data.frame with country and year as column indexes.
}
\details{
  This function computes the sparsity by taking the data
  which are observed between the first and the last
  observation.

  For example, if variable A is observed since 1960 while
  variable B is collected since 1990. When they are merged
  together, NA's will be created for variable prior to 1990
  and these should not be used to calculate the sparsity of
  the data.
